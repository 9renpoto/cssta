# üç™ Mixins

You can define a mixin as follows,

```jsx
const useMixinStyles = cssta.mixin`
  width: 200px;

  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    width: 300px;
  }
`;
```

You can use it in other components using `@include` and then wrapping your mixin name in `${` and `}`.

```jsx
const OtherComponent = cssta(View)`
  @include ${useMixinStyles};
`;
```

## üíó Use in Other Components

We called the variable above `useMixinStyles` because `cssta.mixin` returns a hook.

You can call the hook in your own components too, and when you do, it will return styles that you can then pass to other components.

```jsx
const ComponentThatUsesMixins = ({ children }) => {
  const mixinStyles = useMixinStyles();

  return (
    <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={mixinStyles}>{children}</ScrollView>
  );
};
```

Note that because this is a hook, you _always_ need to call it.
