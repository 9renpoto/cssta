# üñá Editor Integration

Loads of great work has been done for styled-components integration into text editors, including syntax highlighting and linting. Luckily, all styled-components tooling should work with Cssta: you just have call your Cssta import `styled`.

```jsx
import styled from "cssta"

styled(View)`
  color: red;
`
```
