We used to support web and generating CSS files. Some of the code is written in a generic way to support both. I may re-add this later if there's interest

The code used to be flow typed, but is no longer. There are left over flow types from the old code. I aim to add flow types to the new code and get type checking working again

The benchmark likely doesn't work
